## MeLi Challenge

This project is a challenge for Mercado Libre. It is a search engine for products, which shows the results of the search and the details of each product.

## Technologies

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Tech Explanation

I chose Next.js because it is a framework that allows me to create a React application with server-side rendering, as well as image optimizations, which is very useful for **SEO**.

It also allows me to create an API with serverless functions, which is very useful for the backend of the application.

## How to run

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
